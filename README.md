# Crawly

Inspired by [webmagic](https://github.com/code4craft/webmagic), Crawly is an open source web crawler framework for Java which provides a fine-grained component structure. Using it, you can easily setup a web crawler for your production server.

Currently the project is still under rapid development and may change on daily basis. Also, the source code is not tested adequately, tremendous amount of bugs can be found when you're using it.

Use it with cautions.
