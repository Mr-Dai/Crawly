# Crawly

Inspired by [webmagic](https://github.com/code4craft/webmagic), Crawly is an open source web crawler framework for Java which provides a fine-grained component structure. Using it, you can easily setup a web crawler for your production server.

Currently the project is still under construction and is way behind its first release.
